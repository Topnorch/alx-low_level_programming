# Functions, nested loops

Alx school full stack engineer project which aims to teach header files, functions, loops and nested loops in C language.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using 'gcc 4.8.4'
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* C files are tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All programs in the following files are written in C:

|       File name         |          Description                   |
|       ---------         |          -----------                   |
| '0-putchar.c'           | prints '_putchar'                      |
| '1-alphabet.c'          | prints alphabets in lowercase          |
| '2-print_alphabet_x10.c'| prints 10x the alphabet in lowercase   |
| '3-islower.c'           | checks for lowercase character         |
| '4-isalpha.c'           | checks for alphabetic character        |
| '5-sign.c'              | prints the sign of a number            |
| '6-abs.c'               | computes the absolute value of integer |
| '7-print_last_digit.c'  | prints the last digit of a number      |
| '8-24_hours.c'          | print every minute of the day          |
| '9-times_table.c'       | prints 9x table starting with 10       |
| '10-add.c'              | adds two intergers and returns a result|
| '11-print_to_98.c'      | prins all natural numbers from n to 98 |
